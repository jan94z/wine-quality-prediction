# WORK IN PROGRESS
This is a practice project of mine to cover basic ML deployment workflows including model serving, SQL integration, API design, API security / auth, container-based deployment and unit/integration tests. Besides the coding part, I am also trying to work as agile as possible in an one-person project without real world users/customers ðŸ˜Œ Check out the kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/jan94z/projects/3)


# Wine Quality Prediction
This project provides a simple machine learning API to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties[^1]. It uses a classification model to predict the wine's quality score and exposes the prediction functionality through a FastAPI web service. 
The project includes:
* A PostgreSQL database to store wine samples and features
* A machine learning model trained on the Wine quality dataset
* A FastAPI backend to provide prediction and secure data access endpoints
* Docker support to containerize and run the service easily
* ...\

## Installation guide
### User
Download this repo and execute the following command in the root project folder:
```bash
sudo docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```
Then you can open http://localhost:8000/docs in your browser. 

API calls:
* /health: Checks API health
* /samples: Randomly lists 5 samples of the wine quality dataset from the deployed DB
* /models: Prints the DB model registry.
*  /pred: Predicts the wine quality of a given sample as json input. The model path needs to be entered, too.


### Dev
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python3-venv
```
```bash
python3 -m venv ".venv"
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```
```basb
