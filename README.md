# wine-quality-prediction
This project provides a simple machine learning API to predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties. It uses a trained classification model to predict the wine's quality score and exposes the prediction functionality through a FastAPI web service.\
The project includes:
* A SQL database to store wine samples and features
* A machine learning model trained on the Wine Quality dataset
* A FastAPI backend to provide prediction and data access endpoints
* Docker support to containerize and run the service easily
* Deployment configuration for running the service on Azure App Service
The project is in progress and aims to cover basic ML deployment workflows including model serving, SQL integration, API design and container-based deployment.
